# Introduction to Web Development

An introduction to Web Development (HTML, CSS, & Javascript).

A full-day workshop that teach you how to create website contents with HTML, style them with CSS, and make them interactive with Javascript. Its primary target students are beginner with zero experience in programming.

## Prerequisite

The only prerequisite of this workshop is how to use your computer to do basic tasks e.g. typing and browse Internet. Other than that, you're good to go!

## Credits

This material is inspired by the [Intro to Web Dev V2](https://btholt.github.io/intro-to-web-dev-v2/) workshop, presented by Brian Holt. I've trimmed and modified some contents to fit this 1-day workshop.
