# Introduction

Welcome to this course. I'm excited to introduce you to the world of web development, and hopefully this workshop would help your goal to become proficient in web development.

There is no assumption of your programming knowledge; the only assumption is you know how to use your laptop and how to browse internet.

## Learning Tips for this Workshop

Contrary to what you may think, programming doesn't require you to be a technie or good in science/maths.
Many artists, lawyers, teachers have great success learning how to code.

### It's like learning a new language

However, it doesn't mean that learning programming is easy, but it's more like learning a new language than learning science.

When learning a new language, it's about learning new vocabulary and syntax to how to express yourself. Similarly, programming is all about expressing yourself to computer of what you want it to do. Just like learning language, you get better at programming by practicing and using it, not via reading only.

### It's totally fine to google anything

Everyone that do programming in their daily job google everyday, because there is just too many things to remember.

I would actually say that a good programmer must be good at googling. This may sounds like a joke, but think about it, you need to be aware of something in order for you to google about it, and that's why learning is still important even though you can't memorize them.

Today I'm going to teach you a lot of concepts. In fact, web development could be a semester-long subject in university, and practically you can't really learn all these in one day. So my goal for this workshop is not to make you good enough to become a web programmer tomorrow, but just give you sufficient background and context for you to learn on your own.

### Keep move on if you don't understand some concepts

One thing about learning programming is that, the concepts and ideas are so vast that it's hard to understand all concepts. In the meantime, some concepts are interrelated that you can't understand one without knowing another.

So my advice to you while learning programming is that, if you don't understand some concept, move on. You may or may not get it eventually, you can come back to them later on. It may become easier after you know other concepts in programming. The key is to keep learning.

## Who Am I?

My name is Malcolm. I'm a web developer at a Denmark insurance company called Topdanmark. I build website for my company, creating form to capture customer's data etc. etc. I also work in open source project and organize [a meetup group][react-meetup] that focus on a specific framework, React, which I conducted workshop like today. Previous to that, I worked in Accenture and a startup company.

My current passions are teaching and programming. And I think this combination very good, because programming requires a lot of learning, and I always think teaching is the best way to learn. So, yeah, thanks for joining me on learning this.
