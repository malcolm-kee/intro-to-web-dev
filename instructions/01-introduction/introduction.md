# Introduction

Welcome to this course. I'm excited to introduce you to the world of web development, and hopefully this workshop would help your goal to become proficient in web development.

There is no assumption of your programming knowledge; the only assumption is you know how to use your laptop and how to browse internet.

## Learning Tips for this Workshop

Contrary to what you may think, programming doesn't require you to be a technie or good in science/maths.
Many artists, lawyers, teachers have great success learning how to code.

### It's like learning a new language

However, it doesn't mean that learning programming is easy, but it's more like learning a new language than learning science.

When learning a new language, it's about learning new vocabulary and syntax to how to express yourself. Similarly, programming is all about expressing yourself to computer of what you want it to do. Just like learning language, you get better at programming by practicing and using it, not via reading only.

### It's totally fine to google if you don't remember something

Everyone that do programming in their daily job google everyday, because there is just too many things to remember. If anyone tell you otherwise, he is lying.

However, you need to be aware of something in order for you to google about it, and that's why learning is still important even though you can't memorize them.

One goal of this workshop is to give you enough background and context in order for you to learn on your own.
