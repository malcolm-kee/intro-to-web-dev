# Introduction

Welcome to this course. I'm excited to introduce you to the world of web development, and would be happy if this would help your goal to become proficient in web development.

There is no assumption of your programming knowledge, the only assumption is you know how to use your laptop and how to browse internet.

## Learning Tips for this Workshop

Contrary to what you may think, programming doesn't require you to be a technie or good in science/maths.
Many artists, lawyers, teachers have great success learning how to code.

### It's like learning a new language

However, it doesn't mean that learning programming is easy, but it's more like learning a new language than learning science. When learning a new language, it's all about learning new vocabulary and syntax to how to express yourself, and programming is all about express yourself to computer of what you want it to do. Just like learning language, you get better at programming by practicing and using it, not via reading only.

### It's totally fine to google if you doesn't remember something
