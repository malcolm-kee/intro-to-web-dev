# Conclusion

Congratulations on made it through this workshop!

If you feel there is too much information to absorb and your brain is not working now, it's expected. I've just pour a lot information to you today that people use a week to learn.

Give yourself some time, keep learning. You will feel more confident as time goes.

## Final takeaways

1. Google, Google, Google. That's part of the job.
1. If you're stuck, take a rest and walk around, or continue tomorrow. Programming is a cycle of feeling like an idiot and feeling like the smartest guy in the world. Don't let either feeling go over your head.

1. If something interest you then you can keep learning about it. Go deep into it. That's the fun of programming.

1. Don't compare yourself to others. Programming is a field that keep changing, it means the knowledge totally change every few years, and nobody can keep themselves updated of all the changes. It means there are a lot opportunities for everyone.
